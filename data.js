      "Crypto signals, as the name suggests, are signals or ideas that professional traders acquire using technical and fundamental analysis to trade a certain cryptocurrency. Crypto signals are created in two ways: automated and manual. Automated signals are created by sophisticated software run by trained professionals. Manual crypto signals are created by experienced traders who recognize patterns using advanced tools and indicators. Our signals are manual crypto signals curated by an experienced team of veteran traders. Our signals often specify the type of cryptocurrency to buy, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP",
