Manual crypto signals are created by experienced traders who recognize patterns using advanced tools and indicators. Our signals are manual crypto signals curated by an experienced team of veteran traders. Our signals often specify the type of cryptocurrency to buy, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP",
